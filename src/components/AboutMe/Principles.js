                Hello! My name is Sylvia and I enjoy creating beautiful yet functional things on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2014 when I enrolled in Biotechnology. I went down the wrong path and ended up working for the hospital. After years, I knew this was not the path for me. I started to refresh my skills, took a Bootcamp and attended Harvardâ€™s Introduction to Computer Science course and did an internship at a crypto start-up.
